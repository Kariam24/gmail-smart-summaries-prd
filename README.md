# Gmail Smart Summaries (PRD Project)

**One-liner:** AI-powered Gmail feature that condenses long emails into 2â€“3 key sentences directly in the inbox preview.

This repo contains a concise Product Requirement Document (PRD), mockup flow notes, metrics plan, and privacy considerations
for a PM portfolio project. Itâ€™s idea-first (not code-first) and demonstrates product thinking: problem definition, MVP vs. v2,
user stories, success metrics, and tradeoffs.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
- **Problem:** People lose time parsing long emails; subjects/previews often lack actionable context.

- **MVP:** English-only, summarize emails >200 words, shown in preview + banner in open email.
- **V2:** Action-item extraction, multi-language, searchable summaries, per-label controls.
- **KPIs:** Adoption, engagement (time-to-first-action), 30-day retention, CSAT.
